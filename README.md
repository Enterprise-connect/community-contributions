# Community Contributions
### Purpose:
This repo was setup as a place for our creative, generous, and brilliant users to share with the rest of the EC community the unique tools and content they generated for use by others.

### To Contribute:
If you have a project you would like linked to here, please raise an issue or contact our team on Flowdock via EC Usergroup. Working together, we will provide an appropriate short description to give potential users an idea of what your content aims to do, along with credits to you, the author(s), and a link to the desired repo. We also ask that you include in your project repo a copy of the licenses found [here](https://github.com/Enterprise-connect/community-contributions).


### Dislcaimer:
While the EC team is both inspired and proud to have such talent within their user community, the tools presented here are "as-is". Please see the license.pdf for more information.
