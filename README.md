# Community Contributions
### Purpose:
This repo was setup as a place for our creative, generous, and brilliant users to share with the rest of the EC community the unique tools and content they generated for use by others.

### Dislcaimer:
While the EC team is both inspired and proud to have such talent within their user community, the tools presented here are "as-is". It is advised, and expected, that anyone wishing to use the custom content present here be savvy enough with the subject matter to make a reasonable evalution of the safety, security, and appropriate use of these contributions. The EC team takes no responsibility for any unforeseen outcomes resulting from the use of any tool or content present in this repo. In other words, use this content at your own risk and your sole discretion.
